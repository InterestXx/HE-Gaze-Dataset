# HE-Gaze-Dataset

Dataset for ISMAR2022 paper "Real-time Gaze Tracking with Head-eye Coordination for Head-mounted Displays"， and for IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING (TMC) regular paper "Real-Time Gaze Tracking via Head-Eye Cues on Head Mounted Devices".
The first Multi-modality dataset for Near-eye Gaze Tracking. 


# Study Disclosure Statement

Our study only collected eye images, head movement information, and gaze-related information from each subject and did not involve any biomedical experimentation. The data collection process ensures that each subject's eyes are safe and that any participant's eye exposure to infrared light is controlled to be well below the maximum permissible exposure levels specified in IEC 62471:2006 and the Chinese national standard for the safe use of lasers (GB 7247.1-2012).

HE-Gaze data was collected from fifteen voluntary participants (ages between 18 and 26）. These participants provided written informed consent to release their eye images before participating in the study. There was no selection bias in our choice of participants for the HE-Gaze study, except that we required subjects to have corrected visual acuity above legal blindness. Participants were compensated for their participation and had the option to withdraw from the study at any time. The dataset was anonymized to remove any personally identifiable information, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of all participants.

This study was conducted following ethical guidelines and institutional policies, ensuring minimal risk to participants while maintaining the integrity and scientific value of the research.
